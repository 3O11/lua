# lua-cpp

[ORIGINAL README](README)

Copy of the tarfile available at https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.4 with
a few tweaks to enable easy integration into C++ projects.

Before you decide to use this, please consider using
[this](https://github.com/walterschell/Lua)
instead, as the configuration there is much more robust than here.
This is just a personal project with a planned thin C++ wrapper on top of
the C interface.
